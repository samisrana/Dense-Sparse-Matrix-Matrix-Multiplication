# Dense-Sparse-Matrix-Matrix-Multiplication
This project implements a high-speed matrix-matrix multiplication module in C/C++, optimized with multi-threading, SIMD, and cache miss minimization. It supports large, configurable matrix sizes, dense/sparse matrices, and allows toggling optimization methods. Includes performance evaluations, analysis, and matrix compression discussions.
